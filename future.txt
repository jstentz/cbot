Ideas for the future:
* Use some tool to generate Cmake files to build the project in a much simpler way -- also could hopefully allow for cross-platform
* SFML graphics package for C++
* or just make them purely cmdline and do the graphics in python; then we can just send the data via web stuff (tcp)
* make a way to have versions play each other
* magic bitboards are lit asf, use them
* fix all the bugs that are definitely there with the transposition table
* refactor all of the code into better C++ style
* Maybe its worth making the python side of things a whole different repo -> there might already be a python library to do all of this stuff
* I really need to redo how I do the opening book (it takes so long to load)
* not to mention my config file nonsense is so bad 
* fix the fen string parsing and actually implement the remaining rules of chess lol
